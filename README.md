# My Learning Journey at Trybe

This project is a reflection of what I've learned at Trybe Web Development Bootcamp. It's a website that contains a series of information about my learnings and future goals.

## Project Overview

The website contains a practical summary of what I learned in first week of the bootcamp. It's a simple page with a fixed top bar, a main section, and a footer. The main section contains:

- A list of lessons I've learned
- A list of lessons I still want to learn
- A personal photo
- An article about my learning journey
- A brief description about me
- A link to an external website
- A table for next week's learnings
